# Inkra

This is a program that creates a dashboard for MyCupra vehicles (as of now, only the Born)

It has some nice stats such as current weather conditions, SoC, range, charging speed and time,

I intend to add some controls for climate and charging, but I am as yet undecided how to do it.

It's intended to be used with a Raspberry Pi and Inky-PHAT,
However it works internally with PIL, so you can adapt it for other things.
